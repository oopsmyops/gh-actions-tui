## Making Changes

### Before you start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Create an issue to discuss major changes
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch

### Development process

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines

3. Add or update tests as needed

4. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a pull request

### Commit Message Format

We follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add search functionality to log viewer`
- `fix: resolve viewport scrolling issue`

## Testing

### Writing tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure tests are deterministic and fast
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

### Test coverage

- Aim for good test coverage on new code
- Run tests with coverage: `go test -cover ./...`

## UI/UX Guidelines

### TUI Design Principles

- Keep the interface intuitive and consistent
- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions
- Show helpful key bindings and status information
- Handle errors gracefully with clear messages
- Maintain responsive performance

### Key Bindings

- Provide consistent bindings across views
- Show available keys in help text
- Handle edge cases (empty lists, loading states)
